# assign-gua-from-iapd

Helper script for pfSense. It takes the first address from the top subnet of a delegated `::/56` and assigns it to an interface (typically a WAN interface that is configured in DHCP6 mode where the ISP does not honor `ia-na` or provide a GUA)

_Tested only on pfSense+ 22.05 / Verizon FIOS, but should work for CE as well_

# Setup

1. Copy the script to your pfSense firewall and make it executable (`chmod u+x /root/assign_gua_from_iapd.sh`)
2. Make sure the **DHCP6 Debug** checkbox is enabled at System â†’ Advanced â†’ Networking.

# Usage

```shell
assign_gua_from_iapd.sh <ifname>
```

# Cron etc.

You can schedule this to occur on regular intervals using the Cron package, or use [this small patch][2] (apply with System Patches) to have the script automatically hooked into the dhcp6c request/renew process.

Other integrations such as `devd` (probably needs to wait for FreeBSD 14 which [brings a new `ADDR_ADD` event][1]â€” that will land with pfSense 22.11) are left as an exercise to the reader ðŸ˜‰
